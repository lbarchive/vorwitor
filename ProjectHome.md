Vorwitor is not a word processor, not like Microsoft Word or OpenOffice.org Writer. It is not for computer programming, it does not do syntax highlighting. It is very simple, it does not find or replace. All it does is helping you focus on what your are writing, providing you a light environment without being disturbed.

However, it gives you spell check and language(grammar) check`*`. Also, quick statistics, for example, word count, or dictionary`*` and thesaurus`*`. Maybe a picture browser`*` by side. There are more techniques can help writing or even provide some better enlightenments, hope Vorwitor can adopt them in future.

`*` indicates planned features.
